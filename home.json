However they suffer a minor accident there which involves a mother in labour.So Vivek and Lasya take her to a hospital nearby."

        "description": "#mattdamon #tomcruise #missionimpossible #topgun #MI\nMatt Damon recalls his conversation with Tom Cruise about the Burj Khalifa stunt in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Released in 2011, this fourth installment revitalized the franchise, featuring Cruise scaling the iconic Dubai skyscraper. In the interview for the Max series \"Smartless: On The Road\" (via CinemaBlend), Damon recalled a dinner with Cruise shortly after the film's release. Cruise revealed he secured permission for the stunt by replacing the film's safety advisor.\n“There are the Tom Cruises of the world, who do their stunts, like literally hang off a plane and do that. I remember I had dinner with him once, and it was after he did the [Mission: Impossible movie] where he ran around the building. And I go, ‘Can you tell me how that happened?’ And he’s a really intense guy, and he was like, ‘I’ll tell you how it happened!’ I go, ‘Alright.’ And I’m in.\n“He goes, ‘I’ve been thinking about this shot for 15 years!’ And I’m like, ‘Wow, really?’ He goes, ‘So I go to the safety guy, and I lay it all out.’ Safety guy goes, ‘We can’t do that. It’s too dangerous, you can’t do that. So I get a new safety guy.’\nTom Cruise is known to push boundaries with his high-risk stunts in the Mission: Impossible series. Extensive planning and training precede each stunt, such as the helicopter sequence in Mission: Impossible – Fallout and the motorcycle jump in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, where VFX enhanced a specially constructed ramp. The actor has always embraced challenging roles, pushing his limits since 1986's Top Gun. Known for performing his own stunts, he’s showcased his dedication in films like Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai, and Jack Reacher. In Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise executed death-defying stunts, such as speed-flying down a mountainside and riding a motorcycle off a cliff, then parachuting to safety. Cruise shared on The Graham Norton Show that he has been doing stunts since childhood and continued in acting to enhance storytelling. He emphasized the importance of bringing both physical and emotional elements to a character. At Cannes in 2022, Cruise reiterated his love for stunts, comparing his passion to Gene Kelly's for dancing.\nHere are Cruise’s most daring stunts:\nMission: Impossible (Aquarium Scene) In the 1996 Mission: Impossible, Cruise avoided using a stuntman for a scene involving an exploding aquarium, running with 16 gallons of water chasing him.\nMission: Impossible II (Rock Climbing Scene) In 2000's Mission: Impossible II, Cruise climbed and hung off cliffs with only a safety cable, causing director John Woo significant anxiety.\nTop Gun (Parachute Scene) In 1986's Top Gun, Cruise nearly drowned when water filled his parachute during a scene where his character lifts Goose’s body from the ocean.\nThe Last Samurai (Samurai Sword Scene) In 2003's The Last Samurai, Cruise narrowly avoided a fatal accident when a mechanical horse malfunctioned, bringing him inches from a real samurai sword.\nCollateral (Car Crash Scene) In 2004’s Collateral, Jamie Foxx recounted nearly killing Cruise in a car chase scene, where Cruise was tossed around inside a crashing car.\nEdge of Tomorrow (Car Crash Scene) Emily Blunt recalled almost crashing into a tree with Cruise during a high-speed chase in 2014’s Edge of Tomorrow.\nMission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (Scaling a Skyscraper Scene) In the 2011 film, Cruise scaled Dubai’s 163-floor Burj Khalifa, performing climbs, swings, and runs with only a wire for safety.\nMission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (Plane Scene) In 2015’s Rogue Nation, Cruise clung to the outside of an Airbus 400 during takeoff, secured by a body harness and wires, with additional safety measures to protect him.\nMission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (Underwater Breathing Scene) For another Rogue Nation scene, Cruise trained to hold his breath underwater for six minutes, pushing his limits and worrying crew members.\nMission: Impossible – Fallout (Building Jump Scene) During a building jump in 2018’s Fallout, Cruise broke his ankle, pausing production for six weeks. He shared the incident on The Graham Norton Show.\nMission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (Speed-Flying Scene) In the latest Mission: Impossible, Cruise mastered speed-flying, combining elements of parachute swooping and paragliding to navigate close to mountainsides.\nMI – Dead Reckoning Part One (Motorbike Off a Cliff Scene) Cruise fulfilled a childhood dream by riding a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting down, after extensive training and multiple takes to perfect the stunt.\nVideo Courtesy: Team Coco\nSubscribe to Flickside: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZcnxfqAxJTxjKaW9YaKAQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://flickside.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/flickside_official/\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@flickside_official\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FlicksideM\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FlicksideMovies/"

This really upsets the organizer, who got offered with the chance just because of the heroine. Champak tells the duo that whoever gets a new actress will get a chance to become hero. Bunty and Babla now take this as a challenge and set out to find a heroine for the show. But this leads them into a situation full of mess and hilarious situation.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for the best Bollywood videos, movies and scenes, all in ONE channel http://www.YouTube.com/ShemarooEnt. \n\nLike, Comment and Share with your friends and family.

However, he is rescued by a fisherman who mistakes him for a rich businessman and takes him to hi#s village. To avoid revealing his true identity, Jeetu pretends to be deaf and mute. What follows is a series of hilarious events, misunderstandings, and mistaken identities that will keep you hooked.\n\nThe movie features an ensemble cast of talented actors such as Kareena Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, and Neha Dhupia, who deliver outstanding performances.

Cynical Colonel Jack Durant and stunning Lieutenant Kathleen Nash stumble upon Germany's crown jewels—a trove of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds rivaled only by the Tower of London. Smuggling the priceless loot to New York, the pair becomes entangled with ruthless gangsters while trying to fence the gems. Their troubles escalate when Princess Sophie alerts U.S. Army command to the theft, complicating matters with royal ties to the Allies. As danger closes in from all sides, will Jack and Kathleen's loyalty endure, or will greed and betrayal tear them apart?\n\nStarring: Billy Zane, Lyne Renée, Michael Bowen\n\nDirected by: Paul Breuls\n\nAll of the content on this channel is under legal license from various copyright holders and distributors.

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.\n\nClick here to watch more episodes from 'CID Saves The Day' :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0y08jtgaKIX-oKVrgrFqwgO8TGBoJq_f\n\nPhysics को भी Fail कर देने वाला Case कैसे Crack करेगी CID Force? | CID | Latest Episode | 2 Mar 2024"

The film features Naga Chaitanya and Tamanna in the lead roles. Production works began in February 2010, while the filming continued for over one year, with the title only being announced in March 2011. The film features music by Devi Sri Prasad and was released on 6 May 2011. The film was dubbed and released in Malayalam and Tamil with the same title and as Nooru Sadhaveedham Kaadhal / 100% Kaadhal, respectively.\n\nIt was declared a Blockbuster and is said to be the best film of Naga Chaitanya after Ye Maaya Chesave and for Sukumar after Arya, completing 50 days in 65 centres and 100 days on 13 August 2011\n\nPlot :\n\nBalu Mahendra (Naga Chaitanya) is always the top ranker in his college. Mahalakshmi (Tamanna), his cousin comes to Balu’s house to continue her studies. She is in awe of her Mr. Perfect 'Bava' and takes his help to achieve big in studies. Surprisingly, she surpasses him and becomes the first ranker. Balu gets deeply hurt by this and he resorts to cunning ways to deviate Mahalakshmi. But to his surprise Ajith (Anand) stands first this time. Meanwhile Mahalakshmi's father brings her a marriage proposal, but she doesn’t want to marry him. Balu and Mahalakshmi compromise by agreeing to help each other. Balu helps her in getting the proposal canceled and Mahalakshmi starts deviating Ajith from studies for the sake of Balu, but Balu gets tempted to her in bathroom. When the couple is heading to fall in love, Mahalakshmi unknowingly hurts the ego of Balu and they get separated.\n\nAfter three years they meet again in the hospital because their grandmother suddenly falls ill. While trying to find out how Balu is doing, Mahalakshmi realizes he hadn't changed at all. Both argue a lot until their parents try to get them married. Surprisingly, Balu mentions that he has a girlfriend named Swapna that he hopes to marry. While introducing her to his family, Mahalakshmi notices that Swapna is much more than she is. To get back at Balu, she agrees to get married to Ajith, Balu's former rival in college. Ajith turns out to be the head of a company that makes more than Balu's company. Balu, angry that Ajith is greater than he is, puts his company in risk in hopes that he can surpass Ajith's company. Unfortunately, his partner cheats him, and Balu is on the verge of losing his company. Mahalakshmi works hard to help him out of the hard time as his new project manager. Both make an excellent team and Balu's company is saved.\n\nIn an after party, Balu credits Mahalakshmi for his success. She again unknowingly hurts Balu's ego. This time, Balu confesses that he felt the need to be great in Mahalakshmi's eyes because he loved her. When she tells him she shares his feelings, Balu refuses to believe her.

        "description": "#SCP #Scifi #Horror\nhttps://linktr.ee/mrklayvfx\n\nAfter a terrifying and deadly monster escapes from the SCP Foundation, Inspector Arlia interviews Doctor Daniels, the man responsible for containing the creature. At first Daniels uses the interview to critique and insult the powerful and mysterious 0-5 Council. However, as Arlia shares the horrifying details of the breach, Daniels becomes more and more fearful of the question everyone wants answered: how, exactly, did this happen? \n\nThis short film is based on the SCP Foundation Entry 096-1-A by Dr. Dan, and was made possible by donations from all of our Kickstarter Backers. Proudly shot on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with support from Resolution Rentals and This Is Red Agency. Thank you to everyone who made this possible! \n\n►A DARK MATH Production\n►In Association with INDIEGROUND FILMS\n►Directed/Edited/Visual Effects by KLAY ABELE\n►Produced by NATHANIEL PETERS, ALEX CASSUN, and JASON POSEY\n►Cinematography by ELIOTT ACEVEDO\n►Starring JAMES FITZGERALD and STEPHANIE HAFF\n\nRun Time: 23:45\nRating: Mature Audiences Only\nBudget: $23k\n\nLink to the SCP article: http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096\n\nDirectors Statement:\nI want to thank everyone who pledged to help make this film happen. It was a long journey, but I hope you all enjoy the film. Many late nights went in to making this, and I've learned a lot throughout the process. Enjoy!\n\nWhat is the SCP Foundation?\nOperating clandestine and worldwide, the Foundation operates beyond jurisdiction, empowered and entrusted by every major national government with the task of containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena. These anomalies pose a significant threat to global security by threatening either physical or psychological harm.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLegal: Content relating to the SCP Foundation, including the SCP Foundation logo, is licensed under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 and all concepts originate from http://www.scp-wiki.net and its authors.

Ravichandran and Poonam Dhillon and acted in key roles in big films like C.B.I Shankar and Sangliayana 2. Two successful 1990 films Rani Maharani and Baare Nanna Muddina Rani established him as a top hero of Kannada cinema. Shashi Kumar and Malashri, who acted together in several hit films together are considered one among the all-time great pairs of Kannada cinema. He was also paired with other popular actresses like Sudha Rani, Tara, Soundarya and Sithara.\nAt the peak of his acting career, he suffered a driving accident near the Bangalore Turf Club in the mid 1990s. The ensuing surgeries altered his looks and offers for lead roles from big banners stopped coming his way. This pushed him to take the plunge into politics. He managed a comeback after a gap of 2-3 years, mainly starring in supporting roles in multi-starrers like Yajamana, Habba, Kanasugara, Snehaloka and Yaarige Saluthe Sambala.\n----------------------------------------------\nSubscribe to our Channel\nRSV Media Vision Entertainment : https://tinyurl.com/ul82gyg\nRSV Media Vision Kannada Full Movies : https://bit.ly/31MwS3p"

        "description": "#mattdamon #tomcruise #missionimpossible #topgun #MI\nMatt Damon recalls his conversation with Tom Cruise about the Burj Khalifa stunt in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Released in 2011, this fourth installment revitalized the franchise, featuring Cruise scaling the iconic Dubai skyscraper. In the interview for the Max series \"Smartless: On The Road\" (via CinemaBlend), Damon recalled a dinner with Cruise shortly after the film's release. Cruise revealed he secured permission for the stunt by replacing the film's safety advisor.\n“There are the Tom Cruises of the world, who do their stunts, like literally hang off a plane and do that. I remember I had dinner with him once, and it was after he did the [Mission: Impossible movie] where he ran around the building. And I go, ‘Can you tell me how that happened?’ And he’s a really intense guy, and he was like, ‘I’ll tell you how it happened!’ I go, ‘Alright.’ And I’m in.\n“He goes, ‘I’ve been thinking about this shot for 15 years!’ And I’m like, ‘Wow, really?’ He goes, ‘So I go to the safety guy, and I lay it all out.’ Safety guy goes, ‘We can’t do that. It’s too dangerous, you can’t do that. So I get a new safety guy.’\nTom Cruise is known to push boundaries with his high-risk stunts in the Mission: Impossible series. Extensive planning and training precede each stunt, such as the helicopter sequence in Mission: Impossible – Fallout and the motorcycle jump in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, where VFX enhanced a specially constructed ramp. The actor has always embraced challenging roles, pushing his limits since 1986's Top Gun. Known for performing his own stunts, he’s showcased his dedication in films like Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai, and Jack Reacher. In Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise executed death-defying stunts, such as speed-flying down a mountainside and riding a motorcycle off a cliff, then parachuting to safety. Cruise shared on The Graham Norton Show that he has been doing stunts since childhood and continued in acting to enhance storytelling. He emphasized the importance of bringing both physical and emotional elements to a character. At Cannes in 2022, Cruise reiterated his love for stunts, comparing his passion to Gene Kelly's for dancing.\nHere are Cruise’s most daring stunts:\nMission: Impossible (Aquarium Scene) In the 1996 Mission: Impossible, Cruise avoided using a stuntman for a scene involving an exploding aquarium, running with 16 gallons of water chasing him.\nMission: Impossible II (Rock Climbing Scene) In 2000's Mission: Impossible II, Cruise climbed and hung off cliffs with only a safety cable, causing director John Woo significant anxiety.\nTop Gun (Parachute Scene) In 1986's Top Gun, Cruise nearly drowned when water filled his parachute during a scene where his character lifts Goose’s body from the ocean.\nThe Last Samurai (Samurai Sword Scene) In 2003's The Last Samurai, Cruise narrowly avoided a fatal accident when a mechanical horse malfunctioned, bringing him inches from a real samurai sword.\nCollateral (Car Crash Scene) In 2004’s Collateral, Jamie Foxx recounted nearly killing Cruise in a car chase scene, where Cruise was tossed around inside a crashing car.\nEdge of Tomorrow (Car Crash Scene) Emily Blunt recalled almost crashing into a tree with Cruise during a high-speed chase in 2014’s Edge of Tomorrow.\nMission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (Scaling a Skyscraper Scene) In the 2011 film, Cruise scaled Dubai’s 163-floor Burj Khalifa, performing climbs, swings, and runs with only a wire for safety.\nMission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (Plane Scene) In 2015’s Rogue Nation, Cruise clung to the outside of an Airbus 400 during takeoff, secured by a body harness and wires, with additional safety measures to protect him.\nMission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (Underwater Breathing Scene) For another Rogue Nation scene, Cruise trained to hold his breath underwater for six minutes, pushing his limits and worrying crew members.\nMission: Impossible – Fallout (Building Jump Scene) During a building jump in 2018’s Fallout, Cruise broke his ankle, pausing production for six weeks. He shared the incident on The Graham Norton Show.\nMission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (Speed-Flying Scene) In the latest Mission: Impossible, Cruise mastered speed-flying, combining elements of parachute swooping and paragliding to navigate close to mountainsides.\nMI – Dead Reckoning Part One (Motorbike Off a Cliff Scene) Cruise fulfilled a childhood dream by riding a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuting down, after extensive training and multiple takes to perfect the stunt.\nVideo Courtesy: Team Coco\nSubscribe to Flickside: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZcnxfqAxJTxjKaW9YaKAQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nhttps://flickside.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/flickside_official/\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@flickside_official\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FlicksideM\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FlicksideMovies/"

Yash is a dutiful, responsible and stone-hearted police officer whose only passion in life is crime-fighting. He has no family or loved ones and has been alone in life since he can remember. Everything changes when Yash meets Maya (Genelia D'Souza), an independent and lovely woman. Though the two get off to a rocky start, Maya warms up to him once she realizes he is a police officer, and apologizes for the misunderstandings they had. When Maya gets hit by a car in front of Yash, he rushes her to the hospital. With that, the two bond and start to meet and go out regularly. Maya confesses her love to Yash, but Yash refutes her advances, as he does not want her to become his weakness in his professional life. However, Swati (Sandhya Mridul), the wife of Yash's coworker and friend, convinces Yash that he is in love with Maya as well and Yash decides to get married to her.\nIn the big drug case the unit is investigating, Yash, along with his co-mates, Mahesh Pande(Raj Babbar), Atul Kalseka (Mohnish Bahl) and Kamlesh, kill Reddy (Mukesh Rishi) while he is peddling drugs. Yash, Mahesh & Kamlesh are suspended for killing Reddy instead of arresting him. Reddy's heartless and aggressive brother Vishnu (Vidyut Jamwal) vows to avenge his brother's death by killing all of the officers, including Yash. Yash and the other officers prepare themselves for Vishnu, but Vishnu successfully intrudes into Mahesh's home and brutally murders him after raping his wife Rachana (Anaitha Nair). The event leaves Yash and the other officers shaken but Yash and Maya's marriage take place. Meanwhile, Vishnu decides to attack each of the officers' weaknesses; he kidnaps Swati, Atul's wife, and Atul is forced to tell him where Yash will be that night. Yash and Maya passionately enjoy their wedding night of love and bliss; however, this proves to be their first and last night together, as Vishnu and his henchmen invade the house and attack Yash and Maya the next morning.\nYash is fatally shot and Maya is kidnapped in the attack. Yash miraculously survives the attack. Vishnu tells Atul that he will release Swati if Atul kills Yash. However, Atul cannot bring himself to kill his friend and instead joins forces with Yash to execute a plan against Vishnu and save Maya and Swati. Yash, Atul and Kamlesh all go together to the place where Vishnu has been keeping Maya and Swati hostage and find, in horror, that Swati has already been murdered. In despair and heartbreak, Atul kills himself after seeing Swati's body. Out of the 4 police officers, only two are left now: Yash & Kamlesh. Yash and Kamlesh go together and face Vishnu in a final confrontation. Kamlash is shot but survives. Vishnu shoots Maya in front of Yash and drops her from the second floor. Yash catches her but is unable to save her. Maya assures Yash that she has gotten her wish of being with him and dies in Yash's arms. Anger and sorrow build up in Yash and he brutally finishes off Vishnu, exacting his revenge.\nAt the end, Yash is shown living alone again, having gone back to his professional life. Kamlash calls Yash and tells him that he has found a new informer. Yash turns to Maya's photo before leaving and says that he'll be coming home late tonight.\""

The video is primarily from two prints scanned by the Library of Congress, along with a few other sources. Phantomwise (https://www.youtube.com/c/Phantomwise2/featured) provided all of the footage and valuable help. This version also has scene-by-scene image stabilization, and should be in as close an approximation of the original sequence as possible.\n\nThe music was written for a theater organ, and would have been playable by a real instrument at the time this was released. If you like the music, I have my OTHER music at cwbf.bandcamp.com. I'm also hoping to put up a soundtrack album for this soon.\n\nOne other note: this is slightly shorter than some other versions on YouTube. Those releases include many title cards which were not part of the original film, and which slowed down the film considerably. There is actually more footage in this release than in any other that is presently available online.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you would like copies of higher quality copies of any of my sources."

Hopefully you guys would like to re-live this 2005 classic Anime OVA with NEW MUSIC, SOUND EFFECTS, and entire ENGLISH CAST!\n\nTHANK YOU TO BEYOND MIDGAR for Upscaling the video and casting the voice actors!\n\nHope you like it!\n\n►a 2005 Japanese anime original video animation (OVA) produced by Madhouse and released by Square Enix. It was directed by Morio Asaka and produced by Masao Maruyama, Jungo Maruta, and Akio Ofuji. Tetsuya Nomura acted as the supervising director. The OVA is an alternate rendition of two flashbacks found within the 1997 video game Final Fantasy VII. Last Order was released in Japan with Advent Pieces: Limited, a special edition release of the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, and as a bonus feature in the North American \"Limited Edition Collector's Set\" release of Advent Children.\n\nLast Order is associated with the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, a series of prequels and sequels to the original Final Fantasy VII. Although not an official Compilation installment or canon within it, the OVA has nonetheless been included in official guidebooks. The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII includes the games Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, as well as the film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and the collection of short stories On the Way to a Smile. Last Order's soundtrack was released with the music of Before Crisis, and select songs were later remixed for Crisis Core. The OVA was created due to the success of promotional commercials for Before Crisis, with production lasting six months.\n\n►Cast:\nChristian Sekhanan\nas Zack Fair / Cloud Strife / Sephiroth / Reno / Rude / Hojo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ChristianSekhanan\n\nLuke Word\nas Shinra Military\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/OmegaOptimusSupreme\nhttps://twitter.com/LukeWordOOS\n\nAarlyn\nas Turk (Shotgun)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQtXIw7V6ZfbDbieUm68lg\n\nLady Narration\nas Tifa Lockhart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/LadyNarration\n\nDavid JG Doyle\nas Master Zangan\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Aussieroth7\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm4923389/\n\nRyusuke\nas Shinra Military / Turk (Two Guns)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/WrBlPro\nhttps://twitter.com/SumRGuy\n\nDustin Gonzalez (Rawkfist Voice Over)\nas Shinra Military Commander / Villager / Truck Driver\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDNYA9NJmOJfe4QvhL1mv0Q\n\nJustin Cabanting\nas Turk (Martial Artist) / Shinra Military / Tifa's Father\nhttp://jcabantingvoices.com/\nChaserOfTheDawn#2115\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheOfficialJCabs\nhttps://www.imdb.me/JustinCabanting\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jcabantingva/?hl=en\nhttps://www.twitter.com/jcabantingva\n\nJan Fuzzball\nas Turk (Gun)\nhttps://www.twitter.com/JanFuzzball\n\nMikee Joaquin\nas Turk (Rod)\nhttps://mikeejvo.wixsite.com/voiceover\n\nJon Waters\nas Tseng\nhttps://twitter.com/TheJonwaters\n\n►Music:\nALEX MOUKALA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKRfoZ5t1VBdWfn9k6UgXw\n\nAll characters and footage belong to Square-Enix. we do not claim rights over any of the characters.

This is just a story, so sit back and enjoy, thank you.\n\nCompleted in 2011, Worlds Apart tells the story of a young Central California family caught in an unimaginable situation caused by a global catastrophe. Told through the eyes of a child's teddy bear, Worlds Apart is part cautionary fairytale and part science fiction thriller. The film has garnered fifteen Best Animation awards from festivals around the globe. Many amazingly talented students worked for two years to complete this film. \n\nThis is the third film written, produced, and directed by Michael Zachary Huber.\n\nFor more information on the film you can contact the director at:\n\nmzhuber@gmail.com"

        "description": "When she discovers a pearl in the belly of a fish, a Konkani fisherwoman resigned to a mundane life of daily struggle, abandons her trade and indulges in her wildest fantasy. She buys herself a brightly colored rickshaw (“tuk tuk”) and starts to cruise at lightning speed through the winding roads of her coastal village, with her cats in tow. Finally released from her daily drudgery, ecstatic at her newly found sense of power and freedom, she is the talk of the town and her own greatest hero, when, suddenly, an accident threatens to thwart her indomitable spirit.\n\n An exuberant, wild and joyous tale about a woman’s awakening of dormant desires, that celebrates the thrill of adventure and the triumph of dreaming big and pursuing even our most wacky, psychedelic fantasies against all odds. Soulfully told in loud color and trippy animation, the film has won India’s National Award for Animation\n\n (- Indian Film Festival Los Angeles, 2018)\n\nIt seems like all of Suresh’s stories come from the Mumbai streetscape. The brash and burly fisherwoman that squeezed through the mad traffic jam in Worli, to get to the other side of the road, happened to walk in front of Suresh, who was already frustrated by the delay to get to a client meeting. As the narrow gap between Suresh’s car and the huge BEST bus in the front( yes, that’s what Mumbai’s bus service is called!) was too little for her to pass through, she got irritated at him for being so close to the bus. Showering him with abuses with precious animated gestures for parking so close, she gathered enough momentum to squeeze through that patch.. Eriyat, both rattled and dumbfounded, sat back and wondered if there was any possible comeback to her aggression. He wondered how effortlessly she meted out such choicest cuss words which he considered solely as a man’s license a few minutes before! She kept looking back at him to check if he dared to get back at her. But she didn’t know that he had already made a mental sketch of her. By the time he reached his studio, he had a storyline and character sketch ready!\n\nCredits : \n\nStory and Direction : Suresh Eriyat\nProducer : Nilima Eriyat\nMusic : Rajat Dholakia\nSound Design : Shalini Agarwal\nTheme Song : Chetan Sashital\nSound Re-Recording Mixer : Subir Das\nAll Voices\n(Conceived, Designed and performed ) : Chetan Sashital\nProject lead : Nikhil Joshi , Abhijit Budge\nStying and Design : Suresh Eriyat, Nikhil Joshi\nPre-production Design :Nikhil Joshi, Nivedita Goswami, Hitendra Singh, Shraddhha Matkar, Khayali Pandya\nCharacter Modeling : Nikhil Joshi, Nivedita Goswami, Amar Patel, Keyur Patel, Khayali Pandaya , Aditya Raje\nBackground Modeling : Amar Patel, Keyur Patel, Aditya Raje\n3D Animation team : Anjelo David, Abhijit Budge, Swapnil Patil, Anik Roy, Debajyoti Roychowdhury\nRigging : Hitendra Singh , Anik Roy\nProp  Modeling : Nikhil Joshi, Nivedita Goswami, Amar Patel , Keyur Patel , Khayali Pandya, Aditya Raje\nLighting : Amar Patel, Devender Parmar\nRendering : Hitendra Singh , Aditya Raje, Devender Raje , Amar Patel\nLighting : Amar Patel, Devender Parmar\nShading, Texturing and Matte Painting : Khayali Pandya, Amar Patel, Keyur Patel, Devender Parmar, Ranjit Mondal\nSound Design : Shalini Agarwal, Akash Chowdhary\nSFX Recording : Shalini Agarwal, Mustak Shaik\nFoley Artists : Gupta, Sajjan, Choudhury\nFX, Dynamics and Simulation : Nilesh Dhore, Keyur Patel, Anik Roy\nLead Compositors : Nilesh Dhore, Mohammad Azeem\nCompositing Team : Vinod Shetty, D.

        "description": "With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. \n\nOn March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.\n\nDirected by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?\n\nBest documentary winner: Denver International Film Festival (2017), Warsaw International Film Festival (2017), and Traverse City Film Festival (2017).\n\nOfficial selection at Tribeca Film Festival (2017), BFI London Film Festival (2017), and Critics' Choice Documentary Awards (2017).\n\nFind out more: https://www.alphagomovie.com/\n\n--\n\n\"I want my style of Go to be something different, something new, my own thing, something that no one has thought of before.\" Lee Sedol, Go Champion (18 World Titles).\n\n\"We think of DeepMind as kind of an Apollo program effort for AI. Our mission is to fundamentally understand intelligence and recreate it artificially.\" Demis Hassabis, Co-Founder & CEO, DeepMind.\n\n\"The Game of Go is the holy grail of artificial intelligence. Everything we've ever tried in AI, it just falls over when you try the game of Go.\" Dave Silver, Lead Researcher for AlphaGo."

        "description": "Let’s Eat is a 8 minute animated short film that centers on the relationship between a mother and daughter in a Chinese-American immigrant family. Let’s Eat strives to be a universal story told through a distinctly Asian-American voice.\n\nAs a single parent in an unfamiliar country, Ma’s entire life centers around raising Luan, her rambunctious young daughter. Likewise, Luan spends her childhood indulging in endless quality time with her playful, loving mother. However, as Luan grows up, it isn’t long before daily life interferes and causes mother and daughter to grow apart. By channeling their feelings into cooking, the two strive to find their way back to each other, one homemade meal at a time.\n\nMa and Luan’s tale touches upon mother-daughter relationships, the American immigrant experience, and the unspoken translation of love into food - familiar themes reflected through a fresh perspective often overlooked in mainstream media. We at Anamon Studios aim to share in our similarities as much as we celebrate our differences, and to this end we hope that Let’s Eat will resonate with audiences of all backgrounds and experiences.\n\nwww.letseatshortfilm.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/letseatshortfilm\n@letseatshortfilm\n\n***************************************************************************\n\"Come Back Home\" by Max Loh ft.

Get in tune : -) \n*Binaural beats are fun..and USE HEADPHONES.. but it may not be suitable for epileptics or those prone to seizures. * More info on the \"Soul Fire Academy\" below!\n\n*NEW* MASTER YOUR UNIVERSE 6-Week Manifestation Course \nNow enrolling FREE at http://SoulFireAcademy.com\n\nYou can find my story following Abraham Hicks here: http://traviseric.com/abraham-hicks/\nI’ve been applying the knowledge of Abraham-Hicks for about 7 years now.. and it works. It goes by many names, the law of attraction, the secret laws of the universe, or as I like to put it, following your highest excitement and trusting that everything is working out for your highest good.\n\nThis mindset allows you to take risks. It emboldens you to accept that despite the appearance of things, this world has a beautiful perfection to it. It helps you to know what’s important when designing the life of your dreams. To remember that you can create any experience you desire for yourself.\n\nEach moment you have a chance to decide who you want to be. The law of attraction is continually reminding you of who you have chosen to be until now. It allows you to use the circumstances of your life as the catalyst to awaken yourself to higher and higher possibilities. More of what you want and less of what you don’t want. Abraham-Hicks is the most powerful belief system you can adopt for choosing what you want the picture of your life to look like.\n\nIf things get tough for you and life knocks you down, if you need to get back up, or if you want to stay on the leading edge and see how Abe is answering people's questions today - listen to the Abraham Hicks 2017 playlist. Click Below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nS\nIf you are flying high, want to be flying high fast or just want to be reminded how absolutely amazing you are then this playlist is for you - Abraham Hicks Rampage Playlist. Click Below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nThat way you can stay on the high flying disc moment-after-moment and allow Ester’s voice to continually remind yourself of the guidance that is available to yourself in all times at all hours of the day.\n\nI return to these talks to remember to listen. I’ve used this knowledge to create a life i’ve always wanted for myself where all my desires are coming true and there are unlimited possibilities ahead of me!\n\nI’m not saying every single day is the perfect jaunt through wonderland… Truth be told, we wouldn't want it to be..that’s why we’re here... to experience this..\n\nBut, this earth can be a very serious place to live. These words help me to return to the sense of wonder and focus myself on the most important activity in every moment.\n\nFeeling good.\n\nSee... That’s always made sense to me...\n\nThe idea that if you are not happy, in this now, then the destination you are heading towards will be an unhappy destination.\n\nFocusing on feeling good, following my highest excitement and living my life authentically is my guiding compass. It’s the true north when I get lost out playing in the world.\n\nAbraham Hicks knowledge makes life easier. It makes climbing up from the bottom easier. Knowing where to go next easier. Easier to handle success (and Fame) when you begin to give it to yourself.\n\nI know for me it’s made the ups and downs of entrepreneurship easier. It’s made finding the love of my life easier and it’s made raising our two kids easier. This knowledge is the cheat codes.\n\nIf you want to hear more about the journey I’ve been on with Abraham Hicks my story has grown to three parts now.\n\n(1)http://traviseric.com/abraham-hicks/\n(2) http://traviseric.com/abraham-hicks-e...\n(3) http://traviseric.com/abraham-hicks-e...\n\nI get the best feedback on that story out of anything I put out. If you’ve never read it before start with link (1) ‘My Experience With Abraham Hicks. If you have read the story before, I have updated it to include a part three! Click link (3) to go directly to everything that has been happening since the second post.\n\nRemember… Choose Love...\n\nPeruse what sets your soul on fire.\n\n#abrahamhicks #thesecret #love #lawofattraction #loa #abrahamrampage #manifest #esterhicks #rampage #rampageofappreciation #binaural"

        "description": "Jokabi, creator of the video game lofi series Chilltendo, returns with a brand new Legend of Zelda lofi album, Zelda’s Lofi Kingdom. ▸ https://vgm.fm/lofikingdom\nHe is joined by his brother @MikelTBE  (creator of Zelda & Chill) as a featured artist on 3 songs in this a brand new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild concept album, Zelda’s Lofi Kingdom ▸http://vgm.fm/LofiKingdom\n\n@jokabibeats  is a German lofi hip hop producer whose distinct sound is inspired by his travels across the world. Known for his remixes of music from videogames and anime, as well as his own original compositions, Jokabi is the creator of GameChops' fan-favorite Chilltendo series. His latest, Zelda's Lofi Kingdom, is a 14-track collection of remixes dedicated to the latest installment in The Legend of Zelda series, Tears of the Kingdom. \n\nThe tracklist features familiar favorites from Breath of the Wild including \"Great Fairy Fountain\" and \"Rito Village\", as well as new instant-classics from Tears of the Kingdom, such as the title theme and \"Colgera Battle\" (featuring Mikel of Zelda & Chill fame). Using immersive and organic textures, percussion, and instrumentation, Jokabi elevates the music of the Breath of the Wild duology into a lush lofi experience. Zelda's Lofi Kingdom includes licensed compositions by Manaka Kataoka, Maasa Miyoshi, Masato Ohashi, Tsukasa Usui, Yasuaki Iwata, and Koji Kondo.\n\nStream & Support Zelda’s Lofi Kingdom\n▸ https://vgm.fm/lofikingdom\n\nJokabi writes:\n“The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was released on my birthday while I was traveling Japan for the first time. I was especially hyped about this game and it didn't take long for me to fall in love with it and its soundtrack. \n\nWhat started off with just a few remix sketches ended up in a bigger project and eventually an album. Since the soundtracks in the game have a lot of woodwinds, I decided to add flute and wind elements to many of the tracks.\n\nMy trip through Japan had its influence on the production, and it was while traveling I decided to make a traditional Japanese folk music inspired remix of Fairy Fountain. Some of the flutes in the tracks are \"Dadis\" or \"Shakuhachis\" which are traditional bamboo flutes from China and Japan. \n\nI thought it would be nice to have my brother Mikel feature a few tracks since he ended his Zelda & Chill series with his third album and I'm sure fans would be happy to hear his style represented in Zelda’s Lofi Kingdom.\n\nThe illustrator and animator Voyager Spirit is amazingly talented, and perfectly captured the essence of the music with his stunning artwork. It feels like everything fell into place perfectly.”\n\nZelda's Lofi Kingdom is out now on all online stores and streaming platforms!

These songs are extremely nostalgic and bring out various feelings, especially with the touch of Lo-fi in them. I hope you like it, I worked hard to choose the best songs, made by Lo-fi producers (credits in the video and in the description), to create a very pleasant vibe for all of you! :)\n\n📝 About the \"Lo-fi Music\" channel:\nMy purpose here is to spread good Lo- fi Hiphop artists and producers to the whole world, through compilations, in which I carefully and slowly choose the best songs to put on it. The result of this work are videos that really bring feelings to people and make them meet new Lo-fi artists. More than just showing artists, I want to create a community of lovers and producers of the Lo-fi genre. Making all this happen – sharing artists, creating a community and helping people – is what moves me to continue bringing this content to the world.\n\n🎶 Tracklist:\n\n[00:00] Can't Take My Eyes Off You (Aiivawn Lofi Remix)\nCredits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmQjdvSH5qk\n\n[04:00] Just want to be the one you love by cryst\nCredits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLQEdhCoBE4\n\n[05:58] Fly Me To The Moon - Joytastic Sarah (Prod.

Studies show, that 440 Hz tuning appears to be more dissonant than 432 Hz, which is more natural and in tune with our vibrations and vibrations of our planet. What we listen to is as important as the food and water we consume, because it affects us on every levels. That's why it's important to be selective in music we listen to everyday.\n\n_________________________\n\nWARNING! \n - To prevent hearing loss, do not listen on high volumes!\n - Our audio is aimed to bring positive and therapeutic effects, although results may vary from person to person. In some cases highly sensitive people can experience anxiety, headaches and nausea while listening to the provided audio material. If you experience discomfort while listening - you should immediately stop!\n- Some audio material assists in triggering the meditative state of mind, thus it is not recommended to operate heavy machinery or driving while listening.\n- The changes provided by the audio therapy can be very subtle in the very beginning, so it's recommended to continue listening to the same audio material more than once to achieve positive results.\n\nCreated using MIDI by:\n\nName: Bernd Krueger \nSource: http://www.piano-midi.de\n\nYou can download the audio file here:  https://goo.gl/fYQcAh\n\n❤ Donate to support the channel: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7NDSVTLECWSQ2"

Studies show that 432 Hz is more natural than 440Hz and is more in tune with our vibrational state and vibration of our planet. What we listen to is as vital as the food and water we consume, because it affects us on every level. Therefore it's important to be selective in music we listen to every day. \n\n_________________________\n\n\nWARNING! \n - To prevent hearing loss, do not listen on high volumes!\n - Our audio is aimed to bring positive and therapeutic effects, although results may vary from person to person.

        "description": "Listening to Music (MUSI 112)\n\nProfessor Wright introduces the course by suggesting that \"listening to music\" is not simply a passive activity one can use to relax, but rather, an active and rewarding process. He argues that by learning about the basic elements of Western classical music, such as rhythm, melody, and form, one learns strategies that can be used to understand many different kinds of music in a more thorough and precise way -- and further, one begins to understand the magnitude of human greatness. Professor Wright draws the music examples in this lecture from recordings of techno music, American musical theater, and works by Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy and Strauss, in order to introduce the issues that the course will explore in more depth throughout the semester.\n\n00:00 - Chapter 1.

Larghetto (1:51:36) - Budapest Scoring Symphonic Orchestra\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.\nBorn in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.\n\nHe composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\".\n\nThank you so much for watching this video by Halidon Music channel, we hope you enjoyed it!

You do not have to point it out in the comments over and over again. Secondly, I mainly created this mix for the gym and working out, but you can use it for whatever you want. I did not create any of these speeches or music, I just put it all together. Some of the speakers consist of: Eric Thomas, Elliot Hulse, Will smith, Les Brown, Rocky, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and others. I do not know a lot of the song names or the exact title of a lot of the speeches. I made this mix in a time span of a couple weeks and never kept track of the titles and such. I am sorry for that. There are some repeated speech tidbits, but its not a big deal. I just hope I can get some of you motivated. Enjoy.\n\nListen to it on SoundCloud- https://soundcloud.com/woundedduck/hour-long-motivational-mix\n\nSubscribe- http://full.sc/Zf3O1w\nLike me on facebook- http://full.sc/ZIhzS4\nAdd me on facebook- http://full.sc/VSL9pA\nFollow me on twitter- http://full.sc/VSLfh2"

Players freely choose their starting point with their parachute, and aim to stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. Drive vehicles to explore the vast map, hide in trenches, or become invisible by proning under grass. Ambush, snipe, survive, there is only one goal: to survive.\n\nThank You For Reading All This :)"

        "description": "Professional, competitive video game playing—the phenomenon known as esports—has seen double digit growth for much of the past decade. With a massive following, many say it will soon become an official Olympic event. Throughout the U.S., high schools are launching competitive gaming clubs, and even some colleges are offering scholarships to top players.\n\nIt’s a dream come true for professional esports players—traveling the world and paid salaries to play video games full time for a living.\n\nBut as money continues to pour into the industry, the pressure on these young pros—many still in their teens—is leading to early burnout from high stress, repetitive stress injuries, and grueling practice schedules.\n\nIn this episode of CBSN Originals, we follow pro esports players Doublelift (League of Legends) and Space (Overwatch) as they compete for glory, get an inside look at what it takes to be pro, and explore the risks many are taking to stay at the top.\n\n--\nSubscribe to the CBS News Channel HERE: http://youtube.com/cbsnews\nWatch CBSN live HERE: http://cbsn.ws/1PlLpZ7\nFollow CBS News on Instagram HERE: https://www.instagram.com/cbsnews/\nLike CBS News on Facebook HERE: http://facebook.com/cbsnews\nFollow CBS News on Twitter HERE: http://twitter.com/cbsnews\n\nGet the latest news and best in original reporting from CBS News delivered to your inbox.

Every video takes as many as 10 hours to produce, because we strive to give our fans consistent, high-quality content.\n\nOur popular “Evolution of...” series goes far beyond simply presenting gameplay footage. We take the time to show how a video game property — its gameplay, character designs, graphics, sound direction, etc. — have evolved over time. We include unique voiceover work on each video to enhance the viewing experience.\n\nPeople have been playing video games for decades. In that time, we’ve gone from moving a white line up and down to block a moving pixel, to participating in full-fledged, painstakingly rendered real-time battles with people all over the world. We help older gamers look back on how these experiences have changed throughout their lives, and new gamers to understand the broader context of the series they’re playing for the first time today.\nThe video game medium never stops growing, and we’ll never stop chronicling its evolution.\nEditing and voice-over were made by me."

In total, he won 16 pieces of silverware, including four European Cup crowns, three of which came in successive years, with these four continental triumphs coming in the past five seasons. In terms of individual honours, as a Real Madrid player, he won the Ballon d'Or on four occasions, The Best award twice and claimed the Golden Shoe three times, amongst many other accolades.\n \nCristiano Ronaldo will forever be one of Real Madrid's biggest icons and will represent a unique figure for future generations.\n\nReal Madrid will always be his home.\n\nSUBSCRIBE 🎥 \nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\nFOLLOW US 📱\nFACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/realmadrid\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: http://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid"

Simple + hard =effective. \n\nIn a previous video, we discussed the three criteria for strength and how to apply those to get strong.\n\nIn this video, we discuss the four best strength exercises that fit the three criteria and therefore get us the strongest. These exercises are the squat, deadlift, press and bench press.\n\nThe simplest training program that yields the greatest strength return is the most effective. \n\nFor an effective strength program--the program that best gets you get strong and accomplish your goals--keep it simple and hard. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Barbell Logic, where we believe that health and fitness should be approached with simplicity, logic and reason.\n\nWe focus on strength, health & longevity.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

This will set the tone for your day and you will get your workout done first thing!\n\nWhen I asked my community on Instagram (@growwithjo) what the most difficult part of their days were, there was a huge response saying \"WAKING UP\", \"STARTING MY DAY RIGHT\", \"BEING IN A GOOD MOOD WHEN I WAKE UP\".\n\nI totally get this. Especially if you are waking up early and just not feeling like getting yourself to move out of your bed.\n\nThis is why I created this workout; to help you feel energized when you wake up, to boost your metabolism and for you to lose weight faster!\n\nRemember that exercise is only part of the journey. If your goal is to see a physical change, you will also have to take into consideration the amount and quality of the food that you are eating! \n\nIf your goal is not to lose weight, that's okay! This workout is great for all (especially beginners) - the entire workout is all standing, no equipment is needed, and you can even do this workout in a small space.\n\nIf any of the exercises are too challenging for you or too fast, slow it down, go at your own pace and if you cant continue to do the exercise, just walk in place. The goal is to keep your heart rate elevated so you get that metabolism boost and see RESULTS from this workout!\n\nI know you've got this- there is nothing that can stop you if you put your mind to it!\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:10 Workout\n21:54 Ending Notes\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDISCLAIMER:\nAll information provided by growwithjo is of a general nature and is furnished only for educational/entertainment purposes only.

Its presence on the Games programme has allowed its popularity to increase across the world. This popularity was also strengthened by the creation of the IAAF in 1912. Women's events appeared for the first time at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, while the men's programme was standardised as of the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. Although at the beginning women were authorised to participate in only some events, today their programme is almost identical to that of the men. =========================================\n📲 Subscribe to @olympics: http://oly.ch/Subscribe\n🇨🇳 #Beijing2022 replays: https://oly.ch/B22Replays\n🇯🇵 #Tokyo2020 replays: https://oly.ch/T20Replays \n🗞️ News from the Olympic world: https://oly.ch/News"

Because of that, it’s hard to know what to look for when you try to judge the sport from your couch. One thing that’s easy to see, though? The splash.\n\nIf you’ve watched any Olympics diving coverage, you may have noticed that the splashes athletes make are tiny. Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.\n\nIn this video, Team USA’s head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. \n\nAnd while the sport of diving isn’t all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

You can add any soundtrack you like most yourself. The workout has been designed to train the abdominal muscles (abs). It suits both men and women. There are no particular requirements for this module; you just need to know how to properly perform the exercises involved.\r\n\r\nVersion with music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkKCVCZe474 .\r\nAbs Workout Level 2 (advanced) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44mgUselcDU .\r\nand Level 3 (even more advanced) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrsQH3IPNnQ .\r\n\r\nPROGRAM\r\nPerform this workout every second day (e.g. Mon-Wed-Fri) for at least two weeks. Then you'll be ready to perform the next level of this workout.\r\nGood Luck to get six pack!\r\n\r\nHOW THIS WORKOUT WORKS\r\n1. Working aerobically on your abdominal muscles for over 7 minutes stimulates the capillaries in this area. These in turn increase the blood flow. \r\n2. A greater blood flow means a greater flow of oxygen - and fat only burns in the presence of oxygen.\r\n3. Toned muscles need more calories (kcal) to stay active. Our organism tends to release these calories from the area near the active muscles. So it burns fat in that area.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE THIS WORKOUT\r\n1. The module is designed to work the abdominal area 'aerobically'. Performing it straight after an aerobic workout (e.g.: running, spinning, swimming or other aerobic activities) will improve the positive effect.\r\n2. Learn the instructions for each exercise of this workout. Ensure you perform exercises properly.\r\n3. Pay attention on the correct breathing while performing the exercises. It is very important and will help you  achieve the best results possible.\r\n\r\n8 MINUTES ABS APPLICATION FOR IPHONE & iPOD IS AVAIABLE ON ITUNES!

        "description": "It may seem appealing to make your workout routine more complicated - but does more complicated mean more effective? If you want to get strong, keep it simple. Simple + hard =effective. \n\nIn a previous video, we discussed the three criteria for strength and how to apply those to get strong.\n\nIn this video, we discuss the four best strength exercises that fit the three criteria and therefore get us the strongest. These exercises are the squat, deadlift, press and bench press.\n\nThe simplest training program that yields the greatest strength return is the most effective. \n\nFor an effective strength program--the program that best gets you get strong and accomplish your goals--keep it simple and hard. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Barbell Logic, where we believe that health and fitness should be approached with simplicity, logic and reason.\n\nWe focus on strength, health & longevity. Our goal is to present strength & fitness in a systematic logical progression. This channel aims to be a breath of fresh air in the fitness industry.

        "description": "Finally: a workout suitable for BEGINNERS. // Werbung \n\nWhat makes this \"beginner friendly\"? \n1. I used BASIC movements, that are not too complicated or hard to perform \n2. the workout sequences REPEAT, giving you a chance to get used to the movements & get a better feeling for them \n3. a couple of BREAKS. Haha I know you wanted them! The workout sequences are only between 2 or 4 minutes long. Then it's time to catch a breath! \n4. includes warm up exercises \n5. includes a cool down sequence in the end \n\nBut let's make this clear: I was still feeling a serious burn in my muscles and I was still sweating ♥︎ \nThis video is super effective and especially the SLOWNESS gives you so much room to perform everything concentrated, thinking of the exact muscles you want to train. The burn was seriously insane for me! \n\nNo Equipment necessary and not much space needed :)\nThe video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your muscles more: check out my Sixpack Video, 20min Booty Workout, Sexy Arm Trainings or the Calorie Burn Session! Those ones are quicker & harder. But try your best! \n \n__\n\n➞ Instagram http://www.instagram.com/pamela_rf/\n➞ Food Account http://www.instagram.com/pamgoesnuts/\n\n__\n\nMUSIC by Epidemic Sound \nhttp://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n__\n\nCONTACT ME (business inquires):\npamela_reif@icloud.com\n\nDisclaimer:\nWhen joining me for this workout video, you need to take some precautions as your health and safety is the most important. To avoid any injury or harm, you need to check your health with your doctor before exercising. By performing any fitness exercises without supervision like with this video, you are performing them at your own risk.

        "description": "The Phi Phi Islands are a picturesque archipelago in Thailand, located between the large island of Phuket and the Straits of Malacca coast of Thailand. Part of Krabi Province, this group includes the well-known islands of Ko Phi Phi Don and Ko Phi Phi Le, along with smaller islands like Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Ko Mai Phai. Ko Phi Phi Don is the largest and most populated, offering a blend of breathtaking beaches and vibrant local life, while Ko Phi Phi Le gained fame as a filming location for the 2000 film \"The Beach,\" highlighting its natural beauty but also sparking debates on environmental impact.\n\nThe islands are accessible by ferries, speedboats, or long-tail boats, primarily from Krabi town or Phuket Province. The local community, with a population of around 2,500 as of 2018, is predominantly Muslim, although the influx of tourists and transient workers has diversified the demographic. The Phi Phi Islands were severely affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which led to significant reconstruction efforts to restore its infrastructure and tourism industry.\n\nTourism has flourished since \"The Beach\" was released, leading to increased environmental concerns.

Thank You! 🇺🇸\n\nSouth Beach, also nicknamed SoBe, is a neighborhood in the city of Miami Beach, Florida, United States, located due east of Miami city proper between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The area encompasses Miami Beach south of Dade Boulevard.\n\nThis area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, starting in the 1910s, due to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher, the Lummus Brothers, and John S. Collins, the latter of whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches.\n\nThe area has gone through numerous artificial and natural changes over the years, including a booming regional economy, increased tourism, and the 1926 hurricane, which destroyed much of the area. As of 2010, 39,186 people lived in South Beach\n\nBeach in Gta 6 Trailer \n\n#miamibeach #miami #florida\n\n\n\nIf you need to use my video please contact me https://www.instagram.com/artiom.photo/\n\nDo not copy, reproduce, or distribute any of the content."

        "description": "The Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro drivers visited Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, the theme park centred on the Maranello marque. It is located on Yas Island, the venue which hosts the nineteenth and final round of the Formula 1 World Championship. Felipe and Fernando arrived in the Emirates on Tuesday night to bring the curtain down on this closely contested season and today they were taken to the Scuderia Challenge, an attraction in the park which allows people to tackle a simulated lap of the Yas Marina Circuit at the wheel of a 430 Scuderia Challenge car. Four journalists were in attendance, Ottavio Daviddi of Tutto Sport, Stefano Mancini of La Stampa, Laurent Dupin of TF1 and Julien Febreau of Europe 1. These men were the top qualifiers of a competition held yesterday for the international media.\r\n\r\nThe two drivers were bubbling with excitement having just experienced the Formula Rossa, the world's fastest rollercoaster. \"Really incredible,\" was the unanimous verdict of Fernando Alonso who won the first race on the simulator and Felipe Massa, at the end of the breathtaking lap. \"Thanks to this attraction, all lovers of speed, like us will be able to experience, for once in their lives at least, the unique sensation of being launched into the air at 240 kilometres per hour, as well as enjoying what is a truly great day for all real Ferrari fans.\""

Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.\n\nI started a company called CrunchLabs where we build a toy together and then I teach you all the juicy physics for how it works.

        "description": "Welcome to our captivating journey through the fascinating realm of ancient megaliths. In this documentary blog, we will embark on an exploration of remarkable sites scattered across the globe, where colossal stone structures have stood the test of time, leaving us in awe of the advanced skills and ingenuity of our ancient ancestors. From Japan to Peru, from Egypt to Micronesia, these monumental megaliths have puzzled archaeologists, historians, and scientists for centuries. Let's delve into the mysteries surrounding each site and unlock the secrets that lie within.\n\nOur journey commences in Japan's Asuka region, home to the enigmatic Japanese megaliths. These massive stone structures, with their mysterious purposes and intricate carvings, offer a glimpse into the ancient beliefs and customs of the people who once inhabited this land. From towering monoliths to impressive tombs, the Asuka Japanese Megaliths captivate us with their grandeur and raise intriguing questions about their origin and significance.\n\nNext, we venture to Peru to unravel the enigma surrounding the Saywhite Strange Monolith. Rising from the rugged landscape, this peculiar stone formation astounds us with its unique shape and intricate carvings. Join us as we explore the theories surrounding its creation and its potential connection to the ancient civilizations that flourished in the region.\n\nOur quest takes us to the heart of Cusco, Peru, where we encounter the Intihuatana Sundial Megalith. This celestial timekeeping device, perched high in the mountains, reveals the astronomical prowess of the ancient Inca civilization. Journey with us as we uncover the secrets hidden within the Intihuatana and delve into the profound connection between the Inca people and the cosmos.\n\nPrepare to be astounded as we return to Japan to witness the mesmerizing Ishi No Hoden, a floating stone that defies the laws of gravity. How was this massive stone suspended in mid-air without any visible support? Explore the theories behind this perplexing phenomenon and ponder the advanced knowledge possessed by the ancient builders who crafted this astonishing marvel.\n\nVenturing to Central America, we arrive at the ancient Mayan city of Quirigua in Guatemala. The Megalithic Park within this archaeological site presents us with intricately carved stelae and towering stone monuments that depict the rich Mayan history and culture. Join us as we unravel the stories behind these megalithic wonders and gain insight into the lives of the Mayan people.\n\nOur exploration continues in Bolivia, where we encounter the mind-boggling Puma Punku. This site, characterized by its massive stone blocks intricately fitted together, challenges conventional theories about ancient construction techniques. Witness the precision engineering and extraordinary craftsmanship displayed in every colossal stone, compelling us to question the capabilities of ancient civilizations.\n\nOur journey takes us to the land of pharaohs, Egypt, where we uncover evidence of advanced machining techniques employed by the ancient Egyptians.

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Correction: In the video I draw a line pointing to the middle pyramid as The Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid is actually the northern most pyramid of the 3. \n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nWe have a book coming out very soon.

They were still ape-like in appearance, but these were not apes. Their brains grew larger. \n\nThey created stone tools and hunted large game. They discovered fire and learned to follow the migration patterns of the animals they used for food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nIt took a few million years for hominins to discover how to make a stone spearhead. Two million years later, that stone spearhead changed into - a different shaped spearhead. Technology evolved slowly.\n\nBut, three hundred thousand years ago, homo sapiens appeared. And before long, they - we were the dominant species on the planet. Once they destroyed Neanderthals once and for all, something happened. Technology accelerated.\n\nIt only took 30,000 years to go from Gobekli Tepe to landing probes on other planets. How could mankind evolve so fast?\n\nThe answer is: they couldn't. Mankind didn't evolve at all. \n\nMankind was engineered: purpose-built to be the perfect slaves for a race of far superior beings who, according to ancient texts, descended from the heavens.\n\nEventually, the slaves rebelled. And our masters - tried to destroy us in a great flood.\n\nSumerian texts, Egyptian religions, Ancient Indian myths, Native American legends - even the Bible. They all tell the same story.\n\nIt's the story of Gods and Men. It's the story of the Annunaki.\n\n#Annunaki #AncientAliens #AncientAstronaut\n\n〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nThe Hybrid\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nMischief\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nSnowCrash\nRobinSparkles\nBeezySmeezy\nPathos\nTrashPanda\nSmarmyNarwhal\nMaryJaneMcweed\nAC\nSanzel\nOriginal Jim \n\nThe Why Files Theme Lyrics by\nyoutube.com/@straightjacketspaceman9223\n\n〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰\n\n🎧 The Why Files: OPERATION PODCAST 🎧\n🎧 https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast 🎧\n\n〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nBOOK: Humans are not from Earth: a scientific evaluation of the evidence by Ellis Silver\nhttps://amzn.to/3x74ePM\n\nBOOK: The Twelfth Planet by Zecharia Sitchin (Author)\nhttps://amzn.to/3TDq7xG\n\nMan vs Neanderthals:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juyvnVL6V7g\n\nThe Search for Noah's Ark | Giants & Aliens in the Book of Enoch:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n84o7Ggw2Fw\n\nCIA Classified Book about the Pole Shift, Mass Extinctions and The True Adam & Eve Story:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n3fkTq_p0o\n\nTESLA KNEW The Secret of the Great Pyramid: Unlimited Energy to Power the World:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU49FSIx0_g\n\nAre Humans the First Civilization?

        "description": "Welcome to the second cab ride along the world famous, heritage listed Berninanahn (Bernina railway), this time in 4K 60 frames per second quality - and during winter. If you missed the first run along this track, it is worth checking out https://youtu.be/Mw9qiV7XlFs (recorded Autumn 2019).\nA special thank you to Paolo for recording this trip. His channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/dellacapaolo/\n\nThe Bernina railway sets a few records, including being the highest railway alpine crossing in Europe (2253m), the highest adhesion railway of the continent, the open air railway with the greatest height difference (1824m) and furthermore one of the steepest adhesion railways (conventional railway without cogs) worldwide, with gradients of up to 7%.\n\nThe gradients are included in the upper right corner in the same format as they appear to the driver. The arrow indicates whether the gradient is up or down, the larger number is the promille value (1/10 of 1%) and the smaller number indicates the distance of the gradient in meters. You will also see station names with their altitude, tunnel and bridge names with their length and year of construction - as well as other interesting information along the way to improve your viewing experience.\n\nA unique aspect of Switzerland's narrow gauge mountain railways is the mixing of passenger and freight wagons in a single train, with wagons often added or removed at intermediate stops with shunting locomotives. On the Bernina line, the cargo mostly consists of wood on stake cars and derivatives of oil in tank cars. Today we\n take a wagon with us from Pontresina to Poschiavo with good for a Coop supermarket.\n\nThanks for watching and have a great day!\n\nThis video is copyrighted and may not be reuploaded, edited, used or distributed on youtube or outside of this platform without my written consent."

This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. \n\nWe start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.\n\nThis is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.\n\nTo me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species. \n\nFeaturing the voices of David Attenborough, Craig Childs, Brian Cox, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michelle Thaller, Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, Mike Rowe, Phil Plait, Janna Levin, Stephen Hawking, Sean Carroll, Alex Filippenko, and Martin Rees.\n\nBig thanks to Protocol Labs for their support of this creation: https://protocol.ai/ \n\nAnd to my Patreon supporters: Juan Benet, Kalexan, Laine Boswell, Holly, Dave & Debbie Boswell, Abraxas, Alina Sigaeva, Aksel Tjønn, Daniel Saltzman, Crystal, Eico Neumann, geekiskhan, Giulia Carrozzino, Hannah Murphy, Jeremy Kerwin, JousterL, Lars Støttrup Nielsen, Leonard van Vliet, Mitchel Mattera, Nathan Paskett, Patrick Cullen, Randall Bollig, Roman Shishkin, Silas Rech, Stefan Stettner, The Cleaner, Timothy E Plum, Virtual_271, Westin Johnson, Yannic, and Anna & Tyson.\n\nSoundtrack now available: https://bit.ly/2HKl9fi and coming soon to iTunes/Spotify/Etc\n\nPeace and love,\n\nmelodysheep\n@musicalscience\nmelodysheep.com\n\nConcept, music, writing, edit, and visual effects by melodysheep, with additional visual material sourced from:\n\nNASA Goddard\nGoogle\nSpaceX\n2012\nGeostorm\nInto the Universe with Stephen Hawking\nBMW X1 \nJourney to the Edge of the Universe\nNoah\nHow the Universe Works\nDeep Impact\nWonders of the Universe\nMoon raker vfx reel\nVoyage of Time\n\nif you found the text hard to read, check out the large text version:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQpfueZkJ-4\n\nVoice sample sources:\n\nAttenborough Davos Speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuudPum21nE\nCraig Childs - Long Now Talk http://longnow.org/seminars/02013/jul/29/apocalyptic-planet-field-guide-everending-earth/\nBrian Cox - Wonders of the Universe Episode 1 \nNeil deGrasse Tyson interview with Bill Moyers https://vimeo.com/84075447\nHow the Universe Works - Season 3 Episode 2 \nWill The Universe Ever End with Lawrence Krauss https://www.closertotruth.com/series/will-the-universe-ever-end#video-2549\nJanna Levin TED Talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLz9TvxGoKs\nA Brief History of Time (1991) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAfxKExKjVQ\nWhat Happens in the Far Far Future https://www.closertotruth.com/series/what-happens-the-far-far-future\nSean Carroll TEDxCaltech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaTyg8wR4Y\nAlex Filippenko - TEDxSF https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gAtPyEu0G4\nTo Infinity and Beyond: The Accelerating Universe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKdA2-W0X0\nMartin Rees interview http://www.closertotruth.com/series/what-happens-the-far-far-future#video-3625\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/oIuX/"

(Aired January 10, 2018)\n\nOfficial Website:  https://to.pbs.org/3P9TdDL | #novapbs \n\nBlack holes are the most enigmatic and exotic objects in the universe. They’re also the most powerful, with gravity so strong it can trap light. And they’re destructive, swallowing entire planets, even giant stars. Anything that falls into them vanishes…gone forever. Now, astrophysicists are realizing that black holes may be essential to how our universe evolved—their influence possibly leading to life on Earth and, ultimately, us. In this two-hour special, astrophysicist and author Janna Levin takes viewers on a journey to the frontiers of black hole science. Along the way, we meet leading astronomers and physicists on the verge of finding new answers to provocative questions about these shadowy monsters: Where do they come from? What’s inside? What happens if you fall into one? And what can they tell us about the nature of space, time, and gravity?\n\nChapters\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:10:23 What Is A Black Hole?\n00:18:45 How Does A Black Hole Form?\n00:24:40 What Would Happen If You Traveled Into A Black Hole?\n00:29:58 The First Detection of A Black Hole: Cygnus X-1\n00:50:47 The Relationship of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies\n01:12:21 How Do Black Holes Grow?\n01:30:56 New Technologies Giving New View of Black Holes\n01:50:02 Conclusion\n\n© 2018 WGBH Educational Foundation\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nThis program was produced by GBH, which is solely responsible for its content. \n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

        "description": "Given how extensive the subject matter actually is, there is no other film genre that can match up to the creativeness and originality of science fiction. Thanks to this particular genre, we have been able to witness an exciting array of remarkable, mind-boggling movies. But, while it is true that we fondly remember flicks like The Terminator, Independence Day, Men In Black, The Matrix, Inception, and Avatar amongst many others, there also seems to be an entire range of the sci-fi genre that has simply been brushed aside. So, in today’s video, we are going to take a peek at 11 of these underrated gems from the ’90s that undoubtedly deserve your time."

Gracias a su apoyo ahora cuento con las herramientas para armar Mixes un poco más complejos, aunque he sufrido bastante al momento de editar el video debido a que no cuento con una pc muy potente, pero al final se logró. Como he dicho algunas veces, suelo escuchar muchísimos géneros desde música Indie, Pop, Funk, Disco, Rock, Hard Techno, Rock, Hip Hop, R&B, entre otros... En esta ocasión traigo una pequeña selección de mis favoritos del Rock Alternativo, Pop, Metal de los 90s y 2000s 🤘🏼\n\nFor quite some time I wanted to make Mixes with BPMs and varied tonalities, but not having the necessary tools made it almost impossible for me.  Thanks to your support, I now have the tools to put together slightly more complex Mixes, although I suffered a lot when editing the video because I don't have a very powerful PC, but in the end it was achieved.  As I have said a few times, I usually listen to many genres from Indie music, Pop, Funk, Disco, Rock, Hard Techno, Rock, Hip Hop, R&B, among others...

At the beginning, it comprised disciplines that are difficult to qualify as \"artistic\", such as climbing and acrobatics.\n\nThe foundations of the Olympic gymnastics programme were laid at the 1924 Games in Paris, when the men's apparatus individual and team competitions appeared. In 1928, women were included in the Amsterdam Games. It was not until 1952 that the women's programme was developed, with seven events, and then stabilised at six events as from the 1960 Games in Rome. =========================================\n📲 Subscribe to @olympics: http://oly.ch/Subscribe\n🇨🇳 #Beijing2022 replays: https://oly.ch/B22Replays\n🇯🇵 #Tokyo2020 replays: https://oly.ch/T20Replays \n🗞️ News from the Olympic world: https://oly.ch/News"

        "description": "The Akha in Laos live almost untouched by modern civilization. They still adhere to their archaic customs. But they are on the verge of upheaval. \n\nCut off from the rest of the world, without a paved road, the village of Peryensang Mai has remained almost untouched by modern civilization to this day. Its inhabitants are from the Akha tribe, and they seem to live in a different time: Their language isn’t even written down; their everyday life is defined by the laws and rituals handed down from their ancestors such as animal sacrifices to ward off bad luck. This adherence to customs that are often quite brutal endows the Akha’s lives with stability and direction. The women of the village have a particularly busy life. Because the Akha are largely self-sufficient, their tasks range from agriculture to housework and making traditional clothing. This documentary tells the story of the Laovan family. Mother Yeapheun has always had to work hard to support her large family. Her husband is the village elder and ensures the Akha observe the strict laws and commandments. The couple and their eldest children cannot imagine life beyond the mountaintop, so the family is pinning its hopes on youngest son Kienglom, who has been going to school in a nearby town since he was eleven years old. Like many mountain tribes in Laos, the Akha are facing a difficult choice: between a move down into the valley, which would mean they would have electricity, running water and better medical care - but also abandoning their ancient rituals. The film takes the viewer on an emotional journey of discovery to a tribe torn between tradition and modernity and facing the need to reinvent itself in today's world.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Look at all the stuff you have in it, where your bed, kitchen, bathroom, whatever you have there, take a look and appreciate what you have. As you all know, there are millions upon millions of people in the world who don’t have homes, and it’s a sad thing to witness. Then, there are those who have the most extravagant homes possibly and we go, “Really, though?” And then, there are the people who have homes…but those homes aren’t exactly the most…standard affairs that you can picture.

        "description": "In this documentary we know the culture of Australian Aboriginal tribes.\nSUBSCRIBE! http://bit.ly/PlanetDoc Full Documentaries every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday!\nFULL DOCUMENTARIES | http://bit.ly/Full-Docs\n\nThe Men of the Fifth World is a documentary that shows us the history, culture and traditions of the Australian aborigines, primitive tribes who inhabit these lands.\nThe old Garimala Yakar, tells firsthand how their world is accompanied by the sound of the didgeridoo, the beat of their tradition, which keeps them together and attached to the land.\nThese tribes have had to defend their country from the impositions of the white man when he came to Australia for the first time. The aboriginal culture has faded over time but they never cease to tell their story to the youngest and keep the hope that someday find their truth.\n\nIn the Kakadu National Park lies Ubirrok, where the Rainbow Serpent stopped after creating the world and was painted on a rock so that people could see her. Over time our forefathers left on the rocks a complete collection of images which depict their way of life and their beliefs. On these ancient rocks they also drew figures of the men of that time, warriors and hunters, who used the same spears and harpoons as we do now. \n\nWe share our land with all types of animals, some of them as dangerous the kangaroo is the most characteristic animal of my country. \n\nWhen we get together to dance around the fire, we sing the dreams of the animals, the stories of how they were created. Those that dance and sing paint their faces and bodies with kaolin, to look like the spirits which, according to our beliefs, are of a grey colour. The dance of the women is slower and more measured. They are normally in a state of trance, possessed by the spirits of the forest which protect them. \n\nThe didgeridoo It’s our sacred instrument. The men who know how to play it are very important in our culture. With the didgeridoo they communicate our wishes to the spirits. And they call on them to come to our aid when tragedy befalls us. This sacred instrument brings us closer to the world of our ancestors. It is difficult to play, because you have to blow constantly, using the technique of circular breathing. \n\nThe didgeridoos are made by the ants. Our land, here in northern Australia, is the kingdom of the ants.\n\nOur people were nomads, always moving from one place to another, carrying their few belongings with them. That is why we know the forest so well. In the forest, we know how to get everything we need. The men have always hunted and fished, while our women are expert gatherers. They know where to find edible fruits and roots, and how to get honey. The women have always worked in the forest, carrying out these tasks. No one knows nature like they do. Their work is very dangerous. They often come across the king brown, one of the most poisonous snakes in the world, its bite is always fatal.\n\nHunting and war have always been men’s work, and they have always made their own weapons. Without a doubt, the boomerang is the best known of these.  They are pieces of wood carved with a slight curve, which makes them more accurate when they are thrown. In fact, the spear is our best weapon. We used them in our fight against the white men who invaded our country and drove us off the land that belonged to us. Our spears claim other victims. When the tide goes out, we fish for the dangerous sting rays. These are manta rays that hide in the sand, ready to plunge their enormous stings into anyone who dares disturb them.\n\nOur coasts are full of animals, which traditionally provided us with food. When we have speared an animal, we throw a buoy into the water, with a long rope tied to harpoon. Whenever they catch a giant turtle, the fishermen arrange a feast, right there on the beach, to which all their relatives are invited.\n\n“My people have always felt the need to express themselves through painting, now and since the beginning of time. Our art, now called aboriginal art by the white man’s tourist industry, is born from the dreams of each artist and the intense colours we see in our land. \n\nNear the city of Darwin, my people call to the spirit of the king of the crocodiles with piercing cries. \nIt is a dance of invocation. It is performed whenever someone has to travel to an area where the powerful sea crocodiles live. They ask for its permission and protection, but the great spirit is always asleep, and so they have to cry out to wake him, so that he knows that people have gathered together to dance in his honour.\n\nSUBSCRIBE | http://bit.ly/PlanetDoc\nFULL DOCUMENTARIES | http://bit.ly/Full-Docs\nTRIBES DOCUMENTARIES | http://bit.ly/PlTribes\nFACEBOOK | http://bit.ly/FBPDoc\nTWITTER | http://bit.ly/TwPDoc\nTUMBLR | http://bit.ly/TbPlDoc"

        "description": "This is the story of Japan. In this video, I explore the long and unique history of Japan, the diverse geography of Japan - an archipelago of mountains, forests and volcanoes, the Japanese Economy - perhaps the most sophisticated in the world, and the remarkably rich Japanese culture that has influenced the world in so many ways.\n\n🕐CHAPTERS🕖\n👉0:00 Opening Montage\n👉1:57 Introduction and Titles\n👉3:15 Origins and Early History\n👉7:14 Modern History\n👉15:16 Government\n👉17:01 Physical Geography\n👉22:17 Human Geography and Language\n👉25:13 Economy\n👉28:07 Culture and Summary\n👉31:22 Outro\n\nJapan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.\n\nBut the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (\"Daimyo\") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (\"Warring States\"). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.\n\nThe Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.\n\nSince the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.\n\nThe geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.\n\nJapanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.\n\n--\n📷📹🎥 VIDEO & PHOTO CREDITS ❤️❤️❤️\n👉 https://geodiode.com/nse/japan#creditscore \n\nTitle Music: \"Japan Travel\" by Cyril Nikitin\n\nEnd Music\nShizima3 by PeriTune | http://peritune.com (Creative Commons 4.0)\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\n\n--\n\nPlease support the development of this channel by remembering to 👍 Like, 🔁 Share and 🔴 Subscribe.\n\nYou can also support the production of series like this by becoming a monthly sponsor with Patreon for as little as $2/month 👉 https://patreon.com/geodiode 🥰\n\nMedia Procurement Assistance, Spanish CC Translation: Richard Torres\n\nNarrated, Written and Produced by\nB.J.Ranson\n\nYou can contact me via the website at 👉 https://geodiode.com/contact\nOr you can send an email via this Youtube Channel page 👉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1raaXFgsFBSFR8qNgchF2g/about"

        "description": "Taking up half the continent of South America, Brazil is host to vast array of landscapes and biomes - from the steamy Amazon Rainforests, to the savannah of the Planalto Central, and the lush Atlantic Forests. 🇧🇷\n\nOne of the largest countries in the world in terms of land area and population, it is a unique blend of cultures from Europe, Africa and the native land itself. The history of Brazil is one of colonial exploitation and slavery, that, despite the efforts of enlightened leaders such as Dom Pedro II under the Empire of Brazil, today sees corruption and social inequality hold back what would otherwise already be a major global power. 🇧🇷\n\nDespite its colonial past Brazil worked hard to enter the modern age in the 20th Century under presidents such as Getulio Vargas, and a new capital at Brasilia began in 1960s after a massive modernistic building program under the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The economy continued to expand despite political repression under the dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s, with companies such as Embraer joining an elite club of international aerospace companies developing large aircraft. Brazilian politics has never been quiet and the current president of Jair Bolsonaro continues to divide opinion both at home and abroad. 🇧🇷\n\nA global giant in agriculture, it has become self-sufficient in terms of energy needs, and its manufacturing size is now only second to the USA in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most iconic and famous of all world cities, while giant São Paulo beats even New York in size to be the largest city in the Americas. Indeed Brazil's population is truly massive, over 200 million call themselves Brazilian, and live in diverse cities across all of the States of Brazil, from Curitiba in the South, Belo Horizonte in the centre of Minas Gerais, to Salvador Bahia and Recife in the North-East, and lastly, unique Manaus in the heart of the Amazon. 🇧🇷\n\nThis is the country that brought Samba, Carnival and Bossa Nova to the world and we look at the development and history of this globally influential rhythms. It is the country with the greatest of all national football teams, with players such as Pele and Neymar household names. 🇧🇷\n\n🕐TIMESTAMPS🕖\n👉0:00 Opening Montage\n👉0:59 Introduction and Titles\n👉2:12 Origins and Colonial History\n👉7:42 Independence\n👉10:26 Modern History\n👉16:00 Current Affairs and Government\n👉20:45 Physical Geography\n👉26:31 Human Geography\n👉31:35 Economy\n👉34:05 Global Cultural Impact\n👉36:21 Outro\n\nquestions@360.org"
